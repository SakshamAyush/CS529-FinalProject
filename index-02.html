        <h2><u>Vocational Rehabilitation</u></h2>
        <p> 
            A disability is any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation) and interact with the world around them (participation restrictions).
            Although people with disabilities sometimes refer to a single population, this is actually a diverse group of people with a wide range of needs.</br>
            Vocational Rehab is a process that enables persons with functional, psychological, developmental, cognitive, and emotional disabilities, impairments, or health disabilities to overcome barriers to accessing, maintaining, or returning to employment or other useful occupation.
        </p>
